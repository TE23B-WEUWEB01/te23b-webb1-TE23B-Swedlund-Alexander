<p>Delibird (/ˈdɛliˌbɜːrd/ ⓘ; Japanese: デリバード), is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon franchise. Delibird first appeared in the video games Pokémon Gold and Silver and most of its subsequent sequels. Designed by Game Freak's development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori, it has also appeared in various spin-off titles, such as Pokémon Go and Pokémon Stadium 2, and animated adaptations of the franchise. Delibird is a penguin-like, Santa Claus-inspired Pokémon with a tail that resembles a sack. In the Pokémon anime, Delibird has been voiced by SungWon Cho and Katsuyuki Konishi for the English and Japanese dubs, respectively.</p>
<p>Following its debut, Delibird had a mixed reception. Its weakness in battle, owed partially to the unreliability of its "Present" move, was universally criticized. Reactions to its design were more split, with some believing Delibird to have an endearing appearance, while others described its appearance as off-putting and criticized its sack-like tail as an odd design choice. Iron Bundle, a robotic Pokémon directly inspired by Delibird, became well-known for its high level of combat power, dwarfing its inspiration.</p>
<p>Delibird is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the Pokémon media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games Pokémon Red and Green for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as Pokémon Red and Blue in 1998.[4] In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures' special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Some Pokémon can transform into stronger species through evolution via various means, such as exposure to specific items.[5] Each Pokémon has one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon.[6] A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.[5]
